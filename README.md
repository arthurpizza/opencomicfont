# Open Comic Font

NOW IN VERSION 0.03.2! Worked on some of the line width issues that some of the fonts had. More updates to come.
In need of a good comic book font that anyone can use for indy comics, professional comics, movies, advertising or any other area where a font would have to be purchased.

# Use this mothersucka!

The fastest way to add this font to your site is with CSS:
```
@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arthursucks/opencomicfont@2648465342a217cc26a4b191670d3a3fe4a23556/import.css);
```

## Woff2

```
@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arthursucks/opencomicfont@2648465342a217cc26a4b191670d3a3fe4a23556/import-woff2.css);
```

Style it with:
```
font-family: 'Open Comic Font', sans;
```
## Alternative
If you're lazy (like me) you can just add this to your HTML header:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/arthursucks/opencomicfont@2648465342a217cc26a4b191670d3a3fe4a23556/import.css">
```
And don't forget to add the "opencomicfont" class to your < h1 > or < p > or < span >.
