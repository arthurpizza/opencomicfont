# Open Comic Font

NOW IN VERSION 0.03.2! Worked on some of the line width issues that some of the fonts had. More updates to come.
In need of a good comic book font that anyone can use for indy comics, professional comics, movies, advertising or any other area where a font would have to be purchased.
Now with three licenses to choose from: Creative Commons Attribution LGPL AND Creative Commons Zero

Originally hosted on Google Code.  Last updated in 2009.  Let's build a new version.

The fastest way to add this font to your site is with CSS:
```
@import url(https://cdn.rawgit.com/arthursucks/opencomicfont/master/import.css);
```
Style it with:
```
font-family: 'Open Comic Font', sans;
```
# Alternative
If you're lazy (like me) you can just add this to your HTML header:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/arthursucks/opencomicfont/master/opencomicfont.css">
```
And don't forget to add the "opencomicfont" class to your h1 or p or span.
